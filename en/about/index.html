                    I built my first computer when I was 14. That's when I fell in love with electronics and developed an insatiable desire to understand why things work the way they do.

                    When I realized my parents didn't have all the answers, I turned to Google. That's when my "Why phase" truly began.

                    I was born in Coimbra, grew up in Canas de Senhorim, completed basic education like any other kid (maybe a bit more mischievous), and chose science in high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After high school, my friend Vasco and I applied for the <a href="https://www.gapyear.pt" class="subhref" target="_blank">Gap Year Portugal</a> program, planning to take a sabbatical year to travel the world… Although we made it to the final interviews, unfortunately, we weren't accepted.

                <p>
                    Overwhelmed by the number of courses and with little time to make a thoughtful decision, I decided to go to Spain to learn German.

                    <a href="https://genauakademie.es" class="subhref" target="_blank">Genau Akademie</a> is a German academy in Badajoz. There I learned much more than German, I learned how to live with people of all ages and the most diverse life stories.

                    After a year, I returned to Portugal, which I had never valued so much before. This time it had a special glow. I had made up my mind and applied to the <a href="https://apps.uc.pt/courses/PT/course/8922" class="subhref" target="_blank">Bachelor's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the University of Coimbra</a>, where I was accepted.

                    It was a bit like Coca-Cola: first it's strange, then it grows on you. I didn't get off to a good start, heck, I didn't even have a laptop. I would go to lab classes with my 32 GB flash drive (which cost a fortune back in 2019), so I could upload my work to my desktop at home.

                    Programming was the worst. "Professor, how does the computer even understand what I'm writing?" Around the middle of the first semester, things finally started to click.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I quickly realized that programming was where I felt most comfortable. Project I was one of my favorite courses (for me and most students), where I got to unleash creativity and develop a <a href="https://github.com/ags-neto/Sumbrella" class="subhref" target="_blank">smart umbrella</a> that connected to the internet and changed handle color based on today's rain probability.

                    In my second year, I got to know NEEEC/AAC. This course and especially this student group were everything I hoped for. I'm immensely grateful to have crossed paths with the people I met there. Thank you.

                    What a mess... I wasn't accepted into any of my three destination choices. At the time it was still an integrated master's, and the application score considered not just grades (not that mine were the best) but also the number of completed courses. Since I was only in my second year of a five-year program, I ended up low on the list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't Bologna, Rome, or Torino, but Milano (it had to be Italy, è così). Even though I was used to it, it was still a shock. I ended up in one of Milan's poorer neighborhoods (the grant wasn't great), and to top it off, the police raided my place the first month because my flatmate was a drug dealer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I got over my fear of the Italian mafia, I started attending classes in person. Absolutely incredible, from the architecture to the people, even the air felt different. There was a different kind of rigor in how things were done. Every subject had a free-form final project. It was there, still during my undergraduate studies, that I had my first contact with <a href="https://www.ros.org" class="subhref" target="_blank">ROS</a>—the subject that led me, a year later, to choose a master's in Robotics.

                    I'll be honest, I don't know if it was the best choice. Studying in Italy made me choose this master's, but now I'm in Portugal and things are a bit different... Also, the academic year is halfway through, and I can't switch paths without adding another semester, so I'll see where this takes me...
                    I liked the Robotics course. I'll talk to the professor to see if I can get an internship, and take it from there.

                    “Carlos, being president of the "Carro da Queima" isn't easy. Do you think I can handle it?” “Flórido, what do you mean? You're putting together a list for the NEEEC leadership and want me to be vice-president?” “Of course, Professor. I can start working this week, I'm ready to sign the contract.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so it went. Over these years, I wasn't just the vice-president of a student body representing more than 700 students, and the president of the Queima car, but also a researcher at the Institute for Systems and Robotics, and above all, a student. Everything could have gone wrong, but I reached the end of the parade with a big smile, the end of my mandate with a sense of accomplishment, and the end of my master's with a thesis that, together with my work at ISR, bore the desired outcome. <i>FRA</i>.
