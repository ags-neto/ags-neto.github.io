                    I built my first computer when I was 14. That's when I fell head over heels for electronics and
                    developed an insatiable urge to understand how things work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I realized my parents didn't have all the answers, I turned to Google, and that's when my "why
                    phase" truly began.

                <p>
                    Born and raised in Canas de Senhorim, I went through basic education like any other kid, maybe a
                    bit more cheeky than most. In high school, I naturally chose science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was easily the most distracted (and class clown) in the group, but I formed solid friendships,
                    some of which were quite unexpected. Even with teachers, to this day, we still meet up for lunch
                    now and then just to catch up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of high school, my friend Vasco and I applied for the <a href="https://www.gapyear.pt"
                        class="subhref" target="_blank">Gap Year Portugal</a> program, hoping to take a sabbatical year
                    to travel the world. Sadly, although we made it to the final interviews, we didn't make the cut.

                <p>
                    Overwhelmed by the sheer number of degree options and under pressure to decide fast, I chose to go to
                    Spain and study German. Yep, I went to Spain to learn German (and I didn't even speak Spanish).

                    <a href="https://genauakademie.es" class="subhref" target="_blank">Genau Akademie</a> is a German
                    school with two main groups: one for nurses, another for aspiring bus drivers. I ended up in the
                    best group. But what I learned there went far beyond language, I met people who'd had everything
                    and lost much more. It was humbling. I realized I knew nothing. And that life's hardest lessons
                    often teach the most.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A year later, I returned to Portugal, home, a place I had never truly appreciated before. With
                    clarity and conviction, I applied to the <a href="https://apps.uc.pt/courses/PT/course/8922"
                        class="subhref" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering degree at the University of
                        Coimbra</a>, and was accepted.

                    It was like Coca-Cola, strange at first, then addictive. I didn't start off strong. Heck, I didn't
                    even have a laptop. I'd go to practical classes with a 32 GB flash drive (which cost me a fortune in
                    2019), just so I could transfer files to my old desktop back home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programming? Forget it. "Professor, how does the computer even understand what I'm typing?", I'd
                    ask. But halfway through the first semester, things finally clicked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of the four engineering areas, I felt most comfortable with programming, though I didn't love coding
                    itself. What I truly enjoyed was seeing code come to life through robotics. Project I was one of my
                    favorite courses (as it was for everyone). I got to create a <a
                        href="https://github.com/ags-neto/Sumbrella" class="subhref" target="_blank">smart umbrella</a>
                    that connected to the internet and changed color based on the forecast.

                    In my second year, I found NEEEC/AAC, or maybe it found me. I won't go into details, but at a time
                    when I lost a home, I found another. This course, and especially this student group, became so
                    much more than just school. I'm incredibly grateful to them, for the opportunities, the people, the
                    path.

                    I can't help but speak well of my degree. In fact, if you know me even a little, you've probably
                    heard me say: "Our course is amazing," every time someone brings up tech news.

                    What a mess... My girlfriend and I (same degree) didn't get into any of our top three choices. Back
                    then, the degree was integrated, and selection was based not just on grades (mine weren't stellar)
                    but also on how many credits you had. Being in my second year of a five-year degree didn't help.
                    Bottom of the list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, not Bologna, not Rome, not Turin, we landed in Milan. It had to be Italy, è così. And although I
                    was already "hardened," it was still a shock. We ended up in one of the rougher neighborhoods. First
                    month in, the police raided our place, our flatmate turned out to be a dealer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we got over our fear of the Italian mafia, we actually started going to classes. It was
                    incredible, the architecture, the people, even the air felt different. There was a different rigor
                    to how things were done. Every course ended with a self-directed final project. That's where I had
                    my first hands-on contact with <a href="https://www.ros.org" class="subhref"
                        target="_blank">ROS</a>, the Robotics Operating System. That class was what made me choose
                    Robotics as my master's track.

                    I'll be honest, I don't know if it was the best choice. Studying in Italy led me to pick this
                    specialization, but now that I'm back in Portugal, things are... different. That said, the academic
                    year's already halfway through, and switching tracks would mean staying an extra semester. I'll ride
                    it out and see where it leads.

                <p>
                    "Carlos, being president of the Queima float isn't exactly easy, do you think I can handle it?"
                    "Wait, Flórido, you're building a leadership list for NEEEC and want me to be your VP?" "Of course,
                    Professor. I can start this week, ready to sign the contract."
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that's how it went. Over the last couple of years, I somehow became vice-president of a student
                    union that represents over 700 students, president of the Queima float committee, a research
                    assistant at the Institute of Systems and Robotics... and, above all, a student. Everything could've
                    gone terribly wrong, but it didn't. I crossed the finish line of the parade with a huge smile,
                    wrapped up my term with a sense of purpose, and completed my master's with a thesis that, together
                    with my work at ISR, bore real fruit. <i>FRA</i>.
